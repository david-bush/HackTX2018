The flight delay caused me to miss my daughter's wedding.
The check in was very fast.
Checking in my baggage was a huge hassle.
I waited for hours in the airport after my flight was supposed to depart.
I wish there were more food options on this side of the airport.
I've waited for hours to get through this security line.
Getting through security was very fast this time.
The staff was very rude to me during check in.
My flight showed up on time.
The staff acted very professional during the boarding process.
It's way too hot in this airport.
This staff memember is holding up the line.
I'm very happy with the service at the help desk.
I had no problems with security this time.
What's the hold up on this flight?
I seriously cannot believe how good the customer service was.
How long am I going to have to wait in this line?
The service at the help desk was extremely helpful.
The TSA is taking forever to get people through security.
My flight showed up on time despite the bad weather!
I don't really know what to say about this experience.
